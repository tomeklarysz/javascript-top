import { functionOne } from './functionOne';

functionOne(); // this should work as expected!

// By using ES6 modules, you can keep different parts 
// of your code cleanly separated, which makes writing and 
// maintaining your code much easier and less error-prone. 
// Keep in mind that you can definitely export constructors, 
// classes and factory functions from your modules.
